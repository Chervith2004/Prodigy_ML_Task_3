1.Introduction
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The images are preprocessed, flattened, and then fed into the SVM model for training and testing. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

2.Dataset
The dataset should contain two folders: cats and dogs. Each folder should contain grayscale images of cats and dogs, respectively. The images are resized to 100x100 pixels before being processed.

3.Results
After running the script, you will get the following results:
Accuracy: The accuracy of the SVM model on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: A heatmap plot of the confusion matrix.
Classification Report: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
